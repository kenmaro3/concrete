## Example \#1: Homomorphic Arithmetic Over 3-bit integers

The github project called [demo\_z8z](https://github.com/zama-ai/demo_z8z) is using Concrete to implement exact homomorphic computation with 3-bit integers encrypted in LWE ciphertexts.

The following functions are implemented:

* addition between a ciphertext and a constant
* subtraction between a ciphertext and a constant
* multiplication between a ciphertext and a constant
* addition between two ciphertexts
* subtraction between two ciphertexts
* multiplication between two ciphertexts
* max between two ciphertexts
